React Debugging Documentation
 Project Setup Summary
Project: react-debug-sample

Stack: React (with state, props, and component tree)

Structure:

App.js: Top-level component with input

Parent.js: Receives a prop and passes it to Child

Child.js: Displays the prop value

 Debugging Process Using React Developer Tools
 Step 1: Install and Open React Developer Tools
Installed React Developer Tools extension in Chrome.

Opened the Components tab in DevTools after launching the app.

 Step 2: Inspect Components Tree
Observed the component tree: App > Parent > Child.

ðŸ›  Step 3: Identify Issues
 Bug 1: Missing Prop
Observed: Parent component is not receiving any message prop.

Cause: In App.js, the prop passed is msg, but Parent.js expects message.

 Fix 1: Rename the prop key
Before (in App.js):

jsx
Copy
Edit
<Parent msg={text} />
After:

jsx
Copy
Edit
<Parent message={text} />
 Step 4: Confirm Fix
Reloaded app.

React Dev Tools shows Parent receiving message as prop.

Child correctly displays updated message value.

 Step 5: Test Dynamic Behavior
Changed the input value in App.js.

Verified real-time updates reflected in Child.

Confirmed state and props are flowing correctly.

 Final Result
All components render expected values.

Props are passed correctly.

No console warnings or unexpected behavior.
